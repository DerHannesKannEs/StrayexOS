# StrayexOS
Strayex is 32 bit monotasking operating system with monolithic kernel. Written as hobby OS for learning and entertainment reason.

# Usage of system
Strayex is designed to be run on virtual machines, QEMU and VirtualBox. It's hobby OS, so I designed it only on popular VM apps.
OS is not tested on real hardware.
To use Strayex on VM, just download .ISO file and boot up machine from it, or build OS by yourself on Linux or Windows.
Provided build script is on Linux and need GCC and GNU ld to run.

# Design and Distributions
Strayex is designed to be simple (for me :) ) to understand and to develop.
I make releases every major changes, small changes are minor. The biggest changes are uploaded as new distributions.
In GitHub repository I use "experimental branch to upload code, that may cause unexpected behavior. If you want to use Strayex without working on it's code, don't download this branch!
This software is released under Strayker Free Software License: (link).

Distribution list:
- Pretorian (actually in repository),
